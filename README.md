- EA1, the adaptive EA can be found in `adaptative_ea_bad.py`.
- EA2, the linearly decreasing EA can be found in `decreasing_ea.py`.

## How to run
To **reproduce** the results in the report, update variable `ENEMY` to 2, 7 and 8 in `params.py`, 
and run `results_for_report_parallel.py` respectively.

To **plot** the results, run `results_ass1.py`.

Training stats, weights and plots are all save in `./results/`.
